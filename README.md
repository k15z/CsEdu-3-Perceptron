# CsEdu: 3-Perceptron
This is a neural network based on the multilayer perceptron, with three layers of weights connecting the four layers of nodes. The number of nodes in each of the four layers is configurable, and the network is fully-connected between adjacent layers in the forwards direction. It uses the log-sigmoid function as the activation function, and trains using steepest gradient descent with backpropagation.

_Note: While everything shown here is my own work, the theoretical aspects and general design of the network are heavily influenced by the neural networks course taught by Dr. Eric Nelson at The Harker School._
